# TODO: Add 5-Second Delay Feature for Multiple Tabs

- [x] Modify `openMultipleTabs()` function in index.html to use `setTimeout` for staggered tab openings (5s delay per tab).
- [x] Update the success alert to indicate staggered opening instead of instant.
- [x] Test the feature by opening the page and verifying delays (e.g., for 3 tabs: instant, 5s, 10s).

# TODO: Add Automatic Muting for Opened Tabs

- [x] Modify the script to append &mute=1 to YouTube URLs for automatic muting.
- [x] Ensure the change works with both URL formats (with and without query parameters).
- [x] Test by opening tabs and confirming they start muted.
